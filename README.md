# Train-Scheduler-Firebase

In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app is designed to retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information for the user about various trains, such as arrival times and how many minutes remain until the trains arrive at a particular station. Train Scheduler also allows a user to add a desired route by entering the train name, destination, and how frequently it runs. Enjoy the ride!
